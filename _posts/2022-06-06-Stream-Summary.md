## Just learned how to use Markdown
### Facepalm

1. Learned how to add clickable html links into plotly.
2. Then looked XKCD API wrappers in python
- imported xkcd-wrapper
- --user flag, helps with "check permission error"
Need to learn more about how to get API info using asyncio...
3. Codewars: 
- You can use `(*k)` to reference all arguments 
- *Look Up Table (LUT)*, reference tables, useful.
- `for loops` can iterate through multiple items
  - Example: `for required_score, grade in ((90, 'A'), (80, 'B'), (70,'C')...`
4. `.md` files remove need to use HTML
